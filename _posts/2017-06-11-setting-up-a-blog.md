I've been meaning to start a blog for a while. I've had some static content at [rkpandey.com](http://www.rkpandey.com) for several years now, but I wanted a quick and easy way to host a blog which I could write articles as I found the time. Luckily, Jekyll running on Github pages makes this pretty simple. I did get tripped up in a few places, so I put together a guide for myself that others may find useful as well. 

1. Get your github page. 
2. Setup the domain for it. 
3. Setup the sub-domain for it. 
4. Setup Jekyll.
